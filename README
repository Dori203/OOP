=============================
Book.java - contains the Book class for books in the library.
Patron.java - contains the Patron class for borrowers of books in the library.
Library.java - contains the library class for managing book, patrons, and the current state of books being
 borrowed by patrons.

=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the different classes in a way that the Library class is handling all the relations between
the different objects, by a few arrays. The arrays contain book objects and patron objects, and the ID's for
book and patrons are given by the index of the books and the patrons in their appropriate array.
In that sense, it will not be possible to reduce a book or a patron from the library after they have been
added (a feature that was not requested), but it is very easy to determine a book/patrons ID, and check
weather an ID is eligible / already exists.

This implementation logic makes it possible to operate more than one library, with the same books and patrons,
without interrupting the activity of another library.

=============================
As explained before, the implementation is mostly occurring in the Library class, that handles all other
classes.
